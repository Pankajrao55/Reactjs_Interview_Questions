Q1.What is React?

Ans: React, also known as ReactJS, is a popular and powerful JavaScript library used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs). 
It was developed and maintained by Facebook and has gained significant popularity due to its efficient rendering techniques, reusable components, and active community support.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) on the web. 
React is a declarative, component based library that allows developers to build reusable UI components and It follows the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) approach, which optimizes rendering performance by minimizing DOM updates. 
React is fast and works well with other tools and libraries. 




<!-- import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable called 'count' and a function to update it
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '50px' }}>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter; -->

<!-- import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
 -->



----- Q2.What are the limitations of React?  -----

 Ans:  Some limitations of React include:

1. SEO Challenges: React's client-side rendering can be less SEO-friendly, as search engines may have difficulty indexing content on dynamically rendered pages.

2. Learning Curve: React has a steep learning curve, especially for beginners, due to its complex concepts like JSX, hooks, and state management.

3. Performance Issues: React's frequent re-rendering can lead to performance bottlenecks in large-scale applications if not optimized properly.

4. Heavy Bundle Size: React applications can become bulky, leading to slower load times, unless optimized through code-splitting and lazy loading.

5. JSX Syntax: JSX, while powerful, can be confusing for new developers since it mixes JavaScript and HTML-like syntax.

6. Poor Documentation: React's rapidly evolving ecosystem sometimes leaves documentation and resources behind, making it harder for developers to find up-to-date information.



-------Q3.What is useState() in React?----------


Ans: useState() is a React hook that allows functional components to manage state. It returns an array with two elements:

Current state value: The variable that holds the state.
State updater function: A function to update the state.
You initialize state by passing a default value to useState(), and the updater function can be used to modify the state.

Example:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
Here, count is the state variable (initially set to 0), and setCount is the function used to update count.




------Q4.What is JSX?-----------------------------------------------------

Ans: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.
     It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and structure UI components. 
     JSX is then transpiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel.

Example: 

     const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
     JSX makes React code more readable and intuitive, as it closely resembles HTML while allowing the power of JavaScript for dynamic behavior.




-----Q5.What are the differences between functional and class components?---------------------------

Ans: Functional Components:

     Simpler and easier to write.
     Are just JavaScript functions that accept props and return JSX.
     Use hooks (like useState, useEffect) for managing state and side effects.
     Do not have lifecycle methods (before hooks were introduced).

Class Components:

    More complex and require the class syntax.
    Use this to access props, state, and methods.
    Have built-in lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount, render).
    Can manage state and handle side effects without hooks.
    In short, functional components are simpler and modern, while class components are more feature-rich but less commonly used in newer React code.


--------Q6.What is the use of useEffect React Hooks?-----------

Ans: useEffect() is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or manually updating the DOM. 
     It runs after the render and can be configured to run only when certain dependencies change.

Example: 

      useEffect(() => {
      // Code to run after render (side effect)
      }, [dependency]);

    If no dependencies are passed, it runs after every render.
    If an empty array [] is passed, it runs only once (like componentDidMount).
    If dependencies are provided, it runs when any of them change.




------Q7.What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?--------------------------------

Ans: The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is a lightweight copy that React uses to efficiently update the UI.

     Here's how React uses it:

  1. Initial Render: React creates a Virtual DOM based on the component's JSX structure.
  2. State Change: When the state or props change, React updates the Virtual DOM instead of directly changing the real DOM.
  3. Reconciliation: React compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous version (a process called "diffing").
  4. Efficient Update: Only the differences (diffs) are then applied to the real DOM, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance.

    This process makes React more efficient by reducing direct DOM manipulation, which can be slow.
